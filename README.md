## **Introduction**
**EcoByte** is a web platform designed to promote sustainable food practices. It encourages users to make the most of leftover ingredients by offering:
- **Recipe recommendations** based on available leftovers.
- **Nutritional information** calculated for each recipe.
- A **personalized nutrition calculator** tailored to individual dietary needs.

By utilizing leftover ingredients, EcoByte helps users reduce food waste and adopt healthier eating habits. The platform also supports **dark mode**, allowing users to toggle between light and dark themes for better visual comfort.
